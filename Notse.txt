This project is a Python-based SOC automation framework designed to analyze phishing email alerts end-to-end. It simulates how a Security Operations Center (SOC) investigates phishing incidents by automatically extracting indicators, enriching them with threat intelligence, analyzing email authentication headers, calculating risk, and generating case-based incident reports.

The framework supports both:

Plain text email input (.txt)

Real Outlook email files (.msg)

It produces JSON reports that can be ingested by SIEM/SOAR platforms, demonstrating real-world SOC workflows.

Objectives :

* Reduce manual phishing investigation effort

* Standardize alert triage and decision-making

* Simulate SOAR-style automated response

* Demonstrate SOC → Security Automation skills
